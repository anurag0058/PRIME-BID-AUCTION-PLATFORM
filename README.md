# 🏷️ Prime Bid Auction Platform

A dynamic, role-based auction platform built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). This application allows users to create, manage, and participate in **Prime Bid auctions** with
distinct roles: **Auctioneer**, **Bidder**, and **Super Admin**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Prime Bid Auction Platform** provides a seamless experience for managing online auctions with added control and transparency. The system revolves around three core user roles:

- 👨‍⚖️ **Auctioneer** – Creates and manages auctions.
- 🤝 **Bidder** – Participates in auctions by placing bids.
- 🛡️ **Super Admin** – Has full oversight of all auctions, user actions, and commission verification.

Once a bidder wins an auction, a **commission** is marked as *unpaid* on the auctioneer's side, and they are required to **send it to the Super Admin**. 
The Super Admin oversees all auction activities and user interactions.
